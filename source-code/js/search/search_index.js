Sure, there are all kind of basic text styles you’d probably expect from a text editor. But wait until you see the lists:\n\n\n  \n    That’s a bullet list with one …\n  \n  \n    … or two list items.\n  \n\n\n  Isn’t that great? And all of that is editable. But wait, there’s more. Let’s try a code block:\n\nbody {\ndisplay: none;\n}\n\n  I know, I know, this is impressive. It’s only the tip of the iceberg though. Give it a try and click a little bit around. Don’t forget to check the other examples too.\n\n\n  Wow, that’s amazing.
